This program will accept 3 positive integers (x, y, and z) and
treat these three integers as the lengths of three lines.
It then determines whether a triangle can be formed with these three
lines, and output the type of the triangle (e.g. acute-angled,
right-angled, obtuse-angled, isosceles, and equilateral) if one can
be formed, or a triangle cannot be formed.
Please enter the first positive integer (> 0): Your input '0' is not positive!
